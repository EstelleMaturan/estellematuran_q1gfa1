    <p>Hello! It is really nice to meet you. My name is Estelle Maturan, but you can call me star.
        I am 14 years old. I spend most of my days studying, but I still have plenty of time to play or read my favorite books.
        I enjoy reading fantasy novels, especially those with a little bit drama and comedy.
        I am quite loud at school, but I still find myself agreeable, so please don't feel shy or intimidated around me. 
        I'm looking forward into meeting you personally!</p>
